## 📂 Code Structure

The repository is organized following a standard React project structure, making the codebase modular and scalable.

  * `/src` — Contains the main source code for the React application.
      * `App.js` — The main component that renders the entire application.
      * `index.js` — The entry point of the application.
      * `/components` — A directory for reusable UI components.
      * `/pages` — A directory for individual page components (e.g., `HomePage.js`, `NFTsPage.js`).
  * `/public` — Contains static assets like `index.html` and images.
  * Other files for configuration (`package.json`, `README.md`, etc.).

-----

## 🎯 Future Enhancements

  * Integration with a blockchain backend to enable real functionality (e.g., wallet connections, transaction history).
  * Full development of all individual page sections.
  * Implementation of user authentication and data persistence.
